                        In the school year 2010/11, Daniel took part in a group called the Young People's Advisary Group &#40;YPAG&#41; which was a group of students who are of secondary school age to help at Child Bereavement Charity, now called Child Bereavement UK, create a video for friends of bereaved children, and a video for bereaved children themselves.

                        <br />
        Daniel himself was, and is, a bereaved child, as his father died in a car accident when Daniel was only seven. After many years of grief, Daniel, and his family, discovered the Child Bereavement Charity, a local charity set up to help tackle grief of bereaved children, and to also help them understand that they are not alone in their situation.

                    <p>
                         For their amazing efforts, the group was nominated to be awarded a Diana Champion Volunteer award, of which they were granted, after spending hours of their own time to create these videos. Daniel and one other member of the group were sent to Barclays Wealth in London to attend a ceremony where they were presented the Diana award.

        Some time after this, Daniel asked if he could be a youth amabasador for the Child Bereavement Charity, and he was accepted. <a href="http://www.childbereavement.org.uk/Support/Youngpeople/Youthambassadors" target="_blank"> Click here to see the youth ambassadors page </a>
